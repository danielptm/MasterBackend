Go to the far side here into the canal between Långholmen and Södermalm for a little inner city oasis where polished, wooden boats wait patiently for their owners.

Fear not though, as you come to the front of the park a lazy calmness fills the air.

Running through the bougie area of Östermalm, most tourists will visit Karlaplan (literally just a roundabout in winter, but quite a lovely fountain and shaded area in summer) and not really bother walking down the length of Karlavägen. I urge you to. It's nice.. like, really nice.",

Drawing acts that included Elton John this year - personally I went to Slayer, Alice Cooper and Megadeth and plan to go to see Patti Smith when she performs - there is pretty much something for everyone. It's also great value. Season entrance tickets are 250 SEK, which is generally a lower fee to see any one of these acts alone. The park does have a maximum capacity, which was reached when Elton John performed. Depending on the artist and your preferred location to the stage you may have to go minutes to hours ahead of the start time to be guaranteed a spot in the crowd. Just use common sense though, the bigger the star the earlier you should arrive.",
