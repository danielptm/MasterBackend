 * Created by daniel on 8/7/17.

 * This is a class that contains static methods for mapping data points
 * to User beans. User beans are the objects which are used on the front
 * end. By using these methods, you can produce front end suitable objects.
 *
 * There is dependency created between this class and the database level classes.
 * Remove this dependency by Sending in the raw values instead of the actual
 * database class.
